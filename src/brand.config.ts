/* =============================================================================
 *  brand.config.ts  —  THE ONLY FILE YOU NEED TO EDIT TO MAKE THIS SITE YOURS
 * =============================================================================
 *
 *  This white-label landing template ships with neutral "YourBrand" placeholder
 *  copy so it renders as a working demo out of the box. Replace the values below
 *  with your own, drop your logo/favicon/og image into /public/brand/, run
 *  `npm run build`, and deploy. Nothing else needs touching for a basic rebrand.
 *
 *  👉 Search the codebase for the string "YourBrand" if you ever think you
 *     missed a spot — everything customer-facing flows from this file.
 *
 *  Anything wrapped in [SQUARE BRACKETS] is a placeholder you MUST replace
 *  before going live (especially the legal entity + the testimonials, which
 *  ship empty on purpose — never reuse someone else's reviews or logos).
