          renew automatically at the end of each billing period until cancelled.

          the new price.

        <LegalP>
          The AI agent does not provide legal, medical, financial, tax or other
          regulated professional advice, and its outputs should not be relied
          upon as such. For high-value transactions or decisions that materially
          affect a person&rsquo;s rights or significant interests, you should
          keep a human in the loop. You accept the risk of allowing the AI agent
          to handle conversations without human supervision.

          opportunity, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

        <LegalP>
          We may suspend or terminate the service for cause if you fail to pay

          Terms and fail to cure within a reasonable time, or use the service in
          a way that exposes us to legal or regulatory risk. On termination,
          your right to access the service ends; clauses that by their nature
          should survive (including intellectual property, indemnification,

          updated Terms on this page with a revised &ldquo;Last updated&rdquo;
